# DNA-classification-NLP

## AIM -
The aim of the experiment is to study the DNA in human and chimpanzees and classify the seven different types of proteins that are common in both humans and chimpanzees using the protein sequence data.

## MOTIVATION
From Human Genome Project, it's become clear that comparing the human genome with the genomes of other organisms is an enormously powerful tool for understanding our own biology.The chimpanzee and human genomes are strikingly similar and encode very similar proteins. The DNA sequence that can be directly compared between the two genomes is almost 99 percent identical. When DNA insertions and deletions are taken into account, humans and chimpanzees still share 96 percent sequence identity. At the protein level, 29 percent of genes code for the same amino sequences in chimpanzees and humans. here we have taken six different proteins that are - G protein coupled receptors , Tryosine kinase , Tyrosine Phosphatase , Synthase , Synthetase , Ion Channels and Transcription factor as these proteins are found in both humans and chimps. we have to the aim to classify the 7 classes of proteins by their sequence information.
